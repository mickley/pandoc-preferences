abstract = {Three species of Phlox (Polemoniaceae) were grown in 6 greenhouse treatments. A variety of traits were recorded and the correlations among them were computed for each treatment. The phenotypic correlations between characters are significantly altered when plants are grown under different environmental conditions. These changes in correlation structure result from the differential phenotypic plasticity of traits. Partial correlations between flower production and other traits are also environment-dependent. Such changes can alter the intensity of, and possibly the response to, selection on traits correlated with fitness in natural plant populations.},

abstract = {We investigated the changes in amounts and patterns of phenotypic plasticity which have arisen in the Texas annual Phlox drummondii during domestication. Character means and plasticities were compared for five populations: a wild population, three cultivated varieties (a Tall cultivar and two Dwarf cultivars), and a population of an escaped Tall cultivar naturalized in Texas. To measure plasticity, we scored the responses of 10 characters to six treatments and analyzed both the amount and direction of plastic response. Wild plants are phenotypically distinct from the Tall and Escaped cultivar and from the two Dwarf cultivars. Despite its substantial phenotypic divergence from the Wild population, the Tall cultivar's plasticity has changed little during domestication. Traits most strongly correlated with fitness show the least change in their plasticities. The two Dwarf varieties have very similar plasticities, despite strong phenotypic divergence from the Tall population and despite the fact that they were derived from different Tall lines. This suggests that indirect selection on phenotypic plasticity related to selection for the Dwarf habit has resulted in the characteristic plasticity of the Dwarf lines. The Escaped cultivar has substantially different plastic responses from those of the Wild or cultivated populations.},
